            <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight
                language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the
                objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
            <p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of
                language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended
                for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:</p>
            <li>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its
                Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements
                on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.</li>
            <li>Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on
                a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database,
                provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file
                manipulations on a server.</li>

            <p>JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The JavaScript
                language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript
                follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs which was the
                reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.</p>
            <p>In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime
                system based on a small number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values.
                JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the more common class-based object model. The
                prototype-based model provides dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for individual
                objects. JavaScript also supports functions without any special declarative requirements. Functions can
                be properties of objects, executing as loosely typed methods.</p>

            <p>To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello world" JavaScript
                code:</p>
            <code>function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }</code>
            <code>greetMe("World");</code>
            <p>Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your browser!</p>

            <p>You can declare a variable in three ways:</p>
            <p>With the keyword var. For example,</p>
            <code>var x = 42.</code>
            <code>x = 42.</code>
            <code>let y = 13.</code>
